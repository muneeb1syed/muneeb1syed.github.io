                                    The team headed to a nearby college called Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) for their “Touch Tomorrow” event.  “Touch Tomorrow” is an annual, day long event that allows young kids who live in Worcester county to learn about STEM and Robotics for free.  We were invited to the event, and brought a small section of the playing field along with a few plastic blocks to demonstrate the key features of CraterBot (our robot from last season).  While some team members demonstrated CraterBot, the other members set up a larger field with mini soccer balls and blocks for our Soccer Bots. The Soccer Bots are two small robots the team built as an activity for the young kids at the event to play with. Using two Logitech game controllers, the kids could drive the Soccer Bots around a field and with the press of a button on the game controller, the robot would shoot the ball with the attached arm on the front of the robot.

                                            In the previous year, the team created a ping-pong shooting bot that could be maneuvered and be used to shoot ping pong balls. We had setup a basket and created a challenge for kids to use the robot and fire the ping pong balls into it.

                                <h4>Goal</h4>
                                To Design a small wearable capable of instantaneously alerting medical personnel when the wearer is in a state of critical health.
                                The device must have onboard sensors capable of detecting hazardous materials in the environment, such as fire, gas, and extreme temperatures. It also takes into account the user’s vital conditions like pulse and breathing rate.

                                         To create the blueprint, I used Fusion 360 modeling software to generate the drawings and relevant dimensions. The best part about using CAD software is that gives me a sense of how the shelving will look when completed. It takes the guess-work out of engineering.                                         </p>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Wearable New.jpg" alt="" /></span>	To create a device capable of detecting hazardous conditions, a variety of sensors were used, including: 
                                        <br>1. YG1006 Flame sensor 
                                        <br>2. Mq-7 Gas sensor
                                        <br>3. LM35 Thermistor   
                                        <br>4. Adafruit Pulse Sensor 
                                        <br>5. SIM808 GPS/GSM Chip
                                        <br>6. Buttons for Manual control
                                        <br>
                                        <br>These sensors gave values to a microprocessor called an Arduino Nano. The Arduino Nano is like a small computer capable of receiving data from external hardware which helps it learn and make judements about its surrounding environment.
