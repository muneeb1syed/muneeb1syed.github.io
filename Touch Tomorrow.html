                                	The team headed to a nearby college called Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) for their “Touch Tomorrow” event.  “Touch Tomorrow” is an annual, day long event that allows young kids who live in Worcester county to learn about STEM and Robotics for free. This event draws nearly 10,000 people from all around New England. It brings technology-based organizations, clubs, and companies together to showcase everything from robot demos to making oobleck.   </section>

									<h3>2018</h3>
									<p>We decided to create a ping-pong shooting bot that could be maneuvered and be used to shoot ping pong balls. We had setup a basket and created a challenge for kids to use the robot and fire the ping pong balls into it. </p>

								<h3>2019</h3>
									<p>We brought a small section of the playing field along with a few plastic blocks to demonstrate the key features of CraterBot (our robot from last season). While some team members demonstrated CraterBot, the other members set up a larger field with mini soccer balls and blocks for our Soccer Bots. The Soccer Bots are two small robots the team built as an activity for the young kids at the event to play with. Using two Logitech game controllers, the kids could drive the Soccer Bots around a field and with the press of a button on the game controller, the robot would shoot the ball with the attached arm on the front of the robot.
									</p>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/touch/Soccer Bot.jpg" alt="" /></span> 		The Soccer Bots were constructed using a very basic chassis made out of 4 U-Channels arranged in a pattern that ensures strength and stability for the twisting of the U-Channels. We used Andymark 40:1 gearboxes and geared them down 2:1 using chains, to ensure that the robots were slow enough for the kids so they wouldn’t get hurt. We used omni wheels on the chassis, to ensure that the robots could slide horizontally. We used 3D printed phone cases and a 3D printed battery case for the robot. We also did wire management on the robot by bundling up all of the wires connecting to the Rev Expansion Hub, including motors and batteries.
